### ✅ Phase 2: Configuration Management - **COMPLETED** 
- **Status**: Fully complete (4 of 4 steps complete - 100%)
- **Started**: 2025-06-02
- **Completed**: 2025-06-02
- **Progress**: 
  - ✅ Step 1: Base Configuration Files Created
  - ✅ Step 2: ConfigManager Class Implemented

### ⏳ Phase 3: Code Duplication Elimination - **PENDING**
### ⏳ Phase 4: FL Strategy Improvements - **PENDING**  
### ⏳ Phase 5: Testing Infrastructure - **PENDING**
### ⏳ Phase 6: Logging and Monitoring - **PENDING**
### ⏳ Phase 7: Documentation and Polish - **PENDING**

## Purpose

Track the progress of each refactoring phase, document issues encountered, and maintain a clear record of what has been completed.

## File Structure

Each phase has its own markdown file:
- `phase1_structure.md` - ✅ Project structure reorganization (COMPLETED)
- `phase2_config.md` - ✅ Configuration management implementation (COMPLETED)
- `phase3_duplication.md` - ⏳ Code duplication elimination (TO BE CREATED)
- `phase4_strategies.md` - ⏳ FL strategy improvements (TO BE CREATED)
- `phase5_testing.md` - ⏳ Testing infrastructure (TO BE CREATED)
- `phase6_logging.md` - ⏳ Logging and monitoring (TO BE CREATED)
- `phase7_docs.md` - ⏳ Documentation and polish (TO BE CREATED)

## Major Accomplishments

### ✅ Project Structure Reorganization
- **Complete package restructure**: All Python modules moved to `src/` subdirectories
- **Import system overhaul**: 200+ import statements updated successfully
- **Critical fixes preserved**: All data leakage fixes and hyperparameter improvements maintained
- **Professional layout**: Now follows standard Python package conventions

### ✅ Configuration Management System
- **Hydra integration**: Full Hydra configuration system implemented
- **Type-safe configs**: Comprehensive dataclass hierarchy for all settings
- **Experiment support**: Support for bagging, cyclic, and dev experiments
- **ConfigManager class**: Centralized configuration with 20+ utility methods
- **Entry point integration**: All main scripts (run.py, server.py, client.py, sim.py) use ConfigManager
- **Legacy cleanup**: Removed deprecated argument parsers and hardcoded constants
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive migration guide created
- **Test coverage**: All integration tests passing (7/7)

## How to Update

1. Mark tasks as completed with `[x]`
2. Add any issues encountered in the "Issues Encountered" section
3. Add relevant notes in the "Notes" section
4. Update dates when starting and completing phases
5. Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages

## Template

```markdown
## Phase X: [Phase Name]

### Started: [DATE]
### Target Completion: [DATE]

### Tasks:
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

### Issues Encountered:
- Issue 1: Description and resolution
- Issue 2: Description and resolution

### Notes:
- Important observations
- Decisions made
- Dependencies identified

### Completed: [DATE or "In Progress"]
```

## Daily Updates

Consider adding a daily log entry:
```markdown
#### Day X - [DATE]
- Completed: [What was done]
- Blockers: [Any issues]
- Next: [What's planned next]
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 3 - Code Duplication Elimination)
- Create shared utilities for XGBoost operations (DMatrix creation, model loading)
- Implement centralized metrics calculation functions
- Eliminate duplicated code across federated modules
- Create common data processing utilities

### Short Term (Phase 3 Completion)
- Refactor client and server utilities to use shared functions
- Consolidate visualization and plotting code
- Remove code duplication in hyperparameter tuning
- Validate all experiments work with deduplicated code

### Medium Term (Phase 4-7)
- Implement proper FL strategy classes with state management
- Create comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Add centralized logging and monitoring
- Generate API documentation and user guides

## Phase 2 Achievements Summary

**✅ Configuration Management System - COMPLETED 2025-06-02**

**Key Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ **Centralized Configuration**: All settings managed through YAML files
- ✅ **Improved Maintainability**: No more scattered hardcoded constants
- ✅ **Better Reproducibility**: Configuration saved with experiment outputs
- ✅ **Environment Flexibility**: Easy switching between dev/prod configurations
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Validated configuration with dataclasses
- ✅ **Legacy Code Removal**: Clean codebase without deprecated patterns

**Files Updated:**
- `src/config/legacy_constants.py` - Cleaned up deprecated constants
- `src/federated/utils.py` - Updated to use ConfigManager
- `src/federated/client_utils.py` - Updated to use ConfigManager
- `src/models/use_tuned_params.py` - Updated to use ConfigManager
- All entry points (run.py, server.py, client.py, sim.py) - Integrated with ConfigManager
- Test files updated to use ConfigManager
- `docs/CONFIGURATION_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive migration guide created

The project now has a robust configuration management infrastructure and is ready for Phase 3: Code Duplication Elimination.
