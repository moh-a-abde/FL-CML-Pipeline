# Progress Tracking Directory

This directory contains progress tracking files for the FL-CML-Pipeline refactoring project.

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-06-02)

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Project Structure Reorganization - **COMPLETED** 
- **Status**: Fully complete
- **Completed**: 2025-06-02
- **Key Achievement**: All files moved to proper package structure, imports working

### üîÑ Phase 2: Configuration Management - **IN PROGRESS** 
- **Status**: 2 of 5 steps complete (40%)
- **Started**: 2025-06-02
- **Progress**: 
  - ‚úÖ Step 1: Base Configuration Files Created
  - ‚úÖ Step 2: ConfigManager Class Implemented
  - üîÑ Step 3: Update Entry Points (Next)
  - ‚è≥ Step 4: Test Configuration System
  - ‚è≥ Step 5: Eliminate Legacy Code

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Code Duplication Elimination - **PENDING**
### ‚è≥ Phase 4: FL Strategy Improvements - **PENDING**  
### ‚è≥ Phase 5: Testing Infrastructure - **PENDING**
### ‚è≥ Phase 6: Logging and Monitoring - **PENDING**
### ‚è≥ Phase 7: Documentation and Polish - **PENDING**

## Purpose

Track the progress of each refactoring phase, document issues encountered, and maintain a clear record of what has been completed.

## File Structure

Each phase has its own markdown file:
- `phase1_structure.md` - ‚úÖ Project structure reorganization (COMPLETED)
- `phase2_config.md` - üîÑ Configuration management implementation (IN PROGRESS)
- `phase3_duplication.md` - ‚è≥ Code duplication elimination (TO BE CREATED)
- `phase4_strategies.md` - ‚è≥ FL strategy improvements (TO BE CREATED)
- `phase5_testing.md` - ‚è≥ Testing infrastructure (TO BE CREATED)
- `phase6_logging.md` - ‚è≥ Logging and monitoring (TO BE CREATED)
- `phase7_docs.md` - ‚è≥ Documentation and polish (TO BE CREATED)

## Major Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Project Structure Reorganization
- **Complete package restructure**: All Python modules moved to `src/` subdirectories
- **Import system overhaul**: 200+ import statements updated successfully
- **Critical fixes preserved**: All data leakage fixes and hyperparameter improvements maintained
- **Professional layout**: Now follows standard Python package conventions

### ‚úÖ Configuration Management Foundation
- **Hydra integration**: Full Hydra configuration system implemented
- **Type-safe configs**: Comprehensive dataclass hierarchy for all settings
- **Experiment support**: Support for bagging, cyclic, and dev experiments
- **ConfigManager class**: Centralized configuration with 20+ utility methods
- **Test coverage**: 5/5 ConfigManager tests passing

## How to Update

1. Mark tasks as completed with `[x]`
2. Add any issues encountered in the "Issues Encountered" section
3. Add relevant notes in the "Notes" section
4. Update dates when starting and completing phases
5. Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages

## Template

```markdown
## Phase X: [Phase Name]

### Started: [DATE]
### Target Completion: [DATE]

### Tasks:
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

### Issues Encountered:
- Issue 1: Description and resolution
- Issue 2: Description and resolution

### Notes:
- Important observations
- Decisions made
- Dependencies identified

### Completed: [DATE or "In Progress"]
```

## Daily Updates

Consider adding a daily log entry:
```markdown
#### Day X - [DATE]
- Completed: [What was done]
- Blockers: [Any issues]
- Next: [What's planned next]
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2 - Step 3)
- Update `run.py` to use Hydra decorators and ConfigManager
- Update `server.py` and `client.py` to use ConfigManager  
- Replace legacy argument parsers with configuration system

### Short Term (Phase 2 Completion)
- Test configuration system integration with existing modules
- Eliminate legacy constants and scattered configuration code
- Validate all experiments work with new configuration system

### Medium Term (Phase 3-4)
- Create shared utilities for XGBoost operations
- Implement proper FL strategy classes
- Remove global state and code duplication
