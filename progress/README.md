# Progress Tracking Directory

This directory contains progress tracking files for the FL-CML-Pipeline refactoring project.

## Purpose

Track the progress of each refactoring phase, document issues encountered, and maintain a clear record of what has been completed.

## File Structure

Each phase has its own markdown file:
- `phase1_structure.md` - Project structure reorganization
- `phase2_config.md` - Configuration management implementation
- `phase3_duplication.md` - Code duplication elimination
- `phase4_strategies.md` - FL strategy improvements
- `phase5_testing.md` - Testing infrastructure
- `phase6_logging.md` - Logging and monitoring
- `phase7_docs.md` - Documentation and polish

## How to Update

1. Mark tasks as completed with `[x]`
2. Add any issues encountered in the "Issues Encountered" section
3. Add relevant notes in the "Notes" section
4. Update dates when starting and completing phases
5. Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages
