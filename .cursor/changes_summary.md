# Summary of Changes (Session ending 2025-04-08)

This document summarizes the key code modifications made during the pair programming session focused on integrating a `FeatureProcessor` into the data pipeline.

## Key Goals Achieved:

1.  **Integrated `FeatureProcessor`:** Replaced manual data preprocessing and encoding with a centralized `FeatureProcessor` class for consistency and to prevent data leakage.
2.  **Refactored Data Splitting and Transformation:** Updated `train_test_split` and `transform_dataset_to_dmatrix` functions to utilize the `FeatureProcessor` and handle data format conversions correctly (pandas DataFrame <-> XGBoost DMatrix).
3.  **Corrected Data Handling Logic:** Addressed several bugs related to function signatures, imports, redundant operations, and incorrect feature type classification (`local_orig`, `local_resp`).
4.  **Improved Unlabeled Data Processing:** Ensured the *same* fitted `FeatureProcessor` instance (fitted on training data) is used to preprocess both validation and unlabeled data in the client script.

## Specific File Changes:

### `dataset.py`

*   **`FeatureProcessor` Class:**
    *   Defined feature groups (`categorical_features`, `numerical_features`, `object_columns`).
    *   Implemented `fit` method to learn encoding mappings and numerical statistics from training data.
    *   Implemented `transform` method to apply learned preprocessing steps consistently.
    *   Moved `local_orig` and `local_resp` from `numerical_features` to `categorical_features` to fix a `TypeError` during quantile calculation.
*   **`preprocess_data` Function:**
    *   Modified to accept and utilize a `FeatureProcessor` instance.
    *   Ensured labels are correctly handled (including validation) and features are returned separately.
*   **`transform_dataset_to_dmatrix` Function:**
    *   Updated signature to accept `processor` and `is_training` arguments.
    *   Removed old manual encoding logic.
    *   Calls `preprocess_data` using the provided processor.
    *   Removed a redundant `.to_pandas()` call that caused an `AttributeError`.
*   **`train_test_split` Function:**
    *   Updated signature for clarity and standard arguments (`random_state`).
    *   Replaced Hugging Face `Dataset.train_test_split` with `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` for DataFrame splitting.
    *   Added import for `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`.
    *   Initializes and fits the `FeatureProcessor` on the training split.
    *   Calls `transform_dataset_to_dmatrix` to get DMatrices.
    *   **Modified to return the fitted `FeatureProcessor` instance** along with the train/test DMatrices.
*   **Code Cleanup:**
    *   Removed several unused imports (`Dict`, `List`, `defaultdict`, `NDArrays`).
    *   Removed unnecessary `else` blocks after `return` statements.

### `client.py`

*   **Data Loading:** Updated to load specific train and unlabeled CSV files.
*   **`train_test_split` Call:**
    *   Updated the function call to match the new signature (using `random_state`, expecting DMatrix and processor return values).
    *   Calculated `num_train` and `num_val` from the returned DMatrix objects (`.num_row()`).
*   **Unlabeled Data Preprocessing:**
    *   **Removed the inefficient and error-prone logic** that attempted to reconstruct a DataFrame from `train_dmatrix` to re-fit a processor.
    *   **Now uses the `FeatureProcessor` instance returned directly by `train_test_split`** to preprocess the unlabeled data, ensuring consistency.
    *   Added error handling around unlabeled data preprocessing.
*   **Imports:**
    *   Added necessary imports (`pd`, `xgb`, `np`, `FeatureProcessor`, `preprocess_data`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`).
    *   Removed unused imports (`transform_dataset_to_dmatrix`, `resplit`).
*   **Logging:** Updated log messages for clarity and fixed formatting (using %-formatting).

### `client_utils.py`

*   (No functional changes made in this session, but reviewed during debugging).
