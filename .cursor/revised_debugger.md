Okay, analyzing the logs from the baseline simulation (Task 1.6) reveals mixed results and indicates that the foundational issues are not yet fully resolved. We need to address these before proceeding to hyperparameter optimization (Part 2).

Analysis of Baseline Simulation Results (Rounds 45-50):

Overfitting: Verification Inconclusive. The provided logs focus on evaluation rounds and don't show the client train-merror vs. validate-merror comparison during local training (fit method). We cannot confirm if overfitting was successfully reduced. Action Required: Need to inspect earlier logs or explicitly add logging for this comparison in the client's fit method.
Performance:
Improvement: Aggregated accuracy (~59.4%) and F1 score (~0.604) are notably better than the initial ~50% / ~0.46. This suggests the initial changes (regularization, weighting) had some positive effect.
Degradation: Aggregated MLogLoss is now significantly worse (~1.47-1.51) compared to the initial runs (~1.08). This indicates the model's probability outputs are less calibrated, even if the discrete classification accuracy improved slightly. This is a concern.
Learning: Performance metrics are stagnant across rounds 45-50. There's no sign of further learning or improvement. The initial gains have plateaued completely.
Class Balance:
Partial Improvement: Recall for the benign class improved significantly (from ~0.21 to ~0.59), indicating sample weighting helped.
Bias Persists: The model still heavily over-predicts icmp_tunneling (very high recall, low precision). Overall balance needs further improvement.
Server Logs:
FAILURE: The Aggregated loss for round ...: 0 bug persists (Task 1.4 failed).
FAILURE: The Metrics for round ... is not a dictionary: <class 'tuple'> bug persists (Task 1.5 failed). The workaround code is still active.
Conclusion: The baseline is not yet stable or reasonably performing. Critical server logging bugs remain, learning has stalled, and the increase in MLogLoss is problematic despite accuracy gains. Proceeding to Part 2 (HPO) is not advisable.

Revised Implementation Plan

Part 1 (Revised): Debugging Foundational Robustness

(Priority: Highest - Fix remaining bugs and address performance issues)

Objective: Achieve a stable FL baseline with correct server logging, controlled overfitting, improving performance across rounds (especially logloss), and better class balance.

Task 1.A: Fix Server Aggregation Bugs (Re-attempt)

Target Files: server.py, server_utils.py, or custom Strategy file.
Action 1 (Loss Bug - Task 1.4): Meticulously trace the calculation and logging of the central aggregated loss within the server/strategy code after aggregate_evaluate. Identify why it's incorrectly resolving to 0. Ensure it correctly accesses and logs the aggregated loss value (e.g., metrics['mlogloss'] or metrics['loss']). Hypothesis: It might be trying to access a key that doesn't exist in the final aggregated dictionary due to the tuple issue.
Action 2 (Metrics Bug - Task 1.5): Determine precisely where the tuple containing metrics is being created or returned instead of a Dict[str, Scalar]. Modify the relevant function (likely custom aggregate_evaluate or client evaluate return processing) to ensure the final aggregated metrics passed to Flower's internal logging are in the correct Dict format. Remove the Created new metrics dictionary workaround code once the root cause is fixed.
Verification: Run a short FL simulation (3-5 rounds). Check server logs: Does the Aggregated loss show non-zero, meaningful values? Is the not a dictionary: <class 'tuple'> error gone? Does the standard Flower history log show correct metrics?
Task 1.B: Verify Overfitting Reduction & Collect Training Logs

Target File: client.py (within fit method or function called by it).
Action: Add explicit logging within the client fit method after xgb.train completes (especially if using early stopping) to print the final train-mlogloss, train-merror, validate-mlogloss, and validate-merror (or the metrics at the best early stopping iteration).
Verification: Run a short FL simulation. Check client logs: Is the gap between training and validation error acceptably small? If still large, plan further regularization (see Task 1.D).
Task 1.C: Investigate MLogLoss Increase & Stagnation

Hypotheses:
Regularization/Weighting hurt calibration.
Learning rate (eta) is now too high/low for stable convergence.
FedAvg is struggling with potential non-IID data after initial gains.
Action 1 (Parameter Check): Review the exact XGBoost parameters currently used by clients (defaults + regularization applied in Part 1). Are they sensible?
Action 2 (Learning Rate): Experiment with adjusting eta within the client fit method. Try slightly lower (e.g., 0.05) or slightly higher (e.g., 0.15, 0.2) values during a short test run. Observe impact on both accuracy and MLogLoss trends over a few rounds.
Action 3 (Log Client Updates - Optional/Advanced): Add logging on the server to see the norm/magnitude of parameter updates received from clients. Are they very small, suggesting convergence/stagnation?
Verification: Identify potential reasons for the high logloss and stagnation through experimentation and log analysis.
Task 1.D: Refine Client Training Parameters

Target File: client.py (within fit method or param definition).
Action: Based on findings from Tasks 1.B and 1.C:
If Overfitting Persists: Increase regularization further (lambda, alpha, min_child_weight) or decrease max_depth.
If MLogLoss High/Stagnant: Adjust eta based on Task 1.C findings. Re-evaluate sample weighting (Task 1.3) - ensure it's correctly implemented; perhaps try adjusting weights slightly differently. Consider if early_stopping_rounds needs tuning.
If Class Balance Poor: Revisit sample weighting calculation. Ensure it's applied correctly. Consider if features themselves are causing bias (requires deeper feature analysis - potentially defer).
Verification: Run short FL simulations after adjustments. Observe impact on overfitting metrics, accuracy, MLogLoss trend, and class balance in confusion matrices. Iterate until a better balance is found.
Task 1.E: Re-run Baseline Simulation & Verification (Attempt 2)

Action: Once Tasks 1.A-1.D yield improvements in short tests, run another full FL simulation (run_bagging.sh for >= 10-20 rounds to observe trends).
Verification: Re-evaluate against the full checklist:
Overfitting controlled (Client train/val metrics)? PASS/FAIL
Aggregated Accuracy/F1 improving and >> 60%? PASS/FAIL
Aggregated MLogLoss decreasing or stable at a reasonable level? PASS/FAIL
Performance improving across rounds (not stagnant)? PASS/FAIL
Class balance reasonably good? PASS/FAIL
Server log errors fixed? PASS/FAIL
Decision: Only proceed to Part 2 if all checks pass. If not, continue debugging Part 1.
Part 2: Effective Hyperparameter Optimization (Ray Tune Enhancement)

(Priority: Medium - Deferred until Part 1 PASSES)

Objective: Ensure Ray Tune is configured correctly, avoids data leakage, and runs with sufficient intensity to find genuinely useful hyperparameters for the now robust baseline model.
Tasks: (As defined previously - 2.1 through 2.7)
Task 2.1: Isolate Data Handling within Ray Tune Objective
Task 2.2: Standardize HPO Preprocessing (Sync with final Part 1 client preprocessing)
Task 2.3: Configure Ray Tune Objective, Metric & Mode
Task 2.4: Refine HPO Search Space
Task 2.5: Configure HPO Scheduler
Task 2.6: Add Reproducibility to HPO Trials
Task 2.7: Run Intensive HPO Locally
Part 3: Validation and Integration

(Priority: High - Deferred until Part 2 is complete)

Objective: Confirm that the robustness fixes and optimized hyperparameters lead to the best possible, reliable FL performance.
Tasks: (As defined previously - 3.1 through 3.3)
Task 3.1: Validate Best HPO Parameters (Run FL with optimized params)
Task 3.2: Ensure HPO Data Representativeness
Task 3.3: Final Code Review and Cleanup
Code Integration & Agentic Notes:

Focus implementation efforts for Part 1 (Revised) primarily on client.py (for training parameters, logging, weighting) and server.py/strategy (for aggregation bugs).
Treat each Task (1.A, 1.B, etc.) as a distinct step. Verify results rigorously before proceeding.
Task 1.C might require comparative runs with different eta values.
Task 1.D is iterative â€“ adjust, test (short run), observe, repeat.
Task 1.E is the critical gate before considering HPO (Part 2). Do not proceed if verification fails.
