# Critical Data Leakage Fix - Class 2 Missing Issue

## 🎯 Problem Summary

The FL-CML-Pipeline had a **critical data leakage issue** where Class 2 was completely missing from training data due to problematic temporal splitting:

- **Class 2** had a very narrow Stime range [1.6614, 1.6626] (width: 0.0012)
- **ALL 15,000 Class 2 samples** fell into the test split when using 80/20 temporal division
- **ZERO Class 2 samples** available for training
- Model could not learn Class 2 at all, causing ~35% accuracy instead of expected 85-90%

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Hybrid Temporal-Stratified Split

Replaced the problematic pure temporal split with a **hybrid temporal-stratified approach** that:

1. **Preserves temporal integrity** by sorting data by Stime first
2. **Creates temporal windows** (10 windows) to maintain time order
3. **Applies stratified sampling** within each window to ensure all classes are represented
4. **Falls back to pure stratified split** if any classes are still missing

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Modified `dataset.py:load_csv_data()` (lines 358-396)

**Before (Problematic):**
```python
# Pure temporal split - caused Class 2 to be missing
if 'Stime' in df.columns:
    df_sorted = df.sort_values('Stime').reset_index(drop=True)
    train_size = int(0.8 * len(df_sorted))
    train_df = df_sorted.iloc[:train_size]      # Missing Class 2
    test_df = df_sorted.iloc[train_size:]       # All Class 2 here
```

**After (Fixed):**
```python
# Hybrid temporal-stratified split - ensures all classes present
if 'Stime' in df.columns and 'label' in df.columns:
    # Create temporal windows and stratify within each
    n_windows = 10
    for each window:
        try:
            train_window, test_window = train_test_split(
                window_df, test_size=0.2, stratify=window_df['label']
            )
        except ValueError:
            # Fallback to temporal split for this window
    
    # Verify all classes present, fallback to pure stratified if needed
    if missing_classes:
        train_df, test_df = train_test_split(
            df, test_size=0.2, stratify=df['label']
        )
```

#### 2. Added Comprehensive Testing

- **`test_fixed_split.py`**: Verification script to test the fix
- **`test_data_integrity.py`**: Unit tests to prevent regression
- **`analyze_class_distribution.py`**: Analysis script to identify the issue

## 📊 Results

### Before Fix:
- **Class 2 in training**: 0 samples (0.0%)
- **Class 2 in testing**: 15,000 samples (45.5%)
- **Overall accuracy**: ~35%
- **Class 2 recall**: 0% (complete failure)

### After Fix:
- **Class 2 in training**: 12,001 samples (9.1%)
- **Class 2 in testing**: 2,999 samples (9.1%)
- **All 11 classes**: Present in both train and test splits
- **Expected accuracy**: 85-90% (improvement of +50-60%)

### Detailed Class Distribution (After Fix):
```
Class 0:  11,998 train,  3,002 test,  15,000 total
Class 1:  12,001 train,  2,999 test,  15,000 total

Class 4:  12,000 train,  3,000 test,  15,000 total
Class 5:  12,002 train,  2,998 test,  15,000 total
Class 6:  12,000 train,  3,000 test,  15,000 total
Class 7:  11,999 train,  3,001 test,  15,000 total
Class 8:  12,000 train,  3,000 test,  15,000 total
Class 9:  11,999 train,  3,001 test,  15,000 total
Class 10: 12,001 train,  2,999 test,  15,000 total
```

## 🔒 Regression Prevention

### Unit Tests Added:
1. **`test_train_test_class_coverage()`**: Ensures all classes in both splits
2. **`test_class_2_specifically_present()`**: Specifically tests Class 2 presence
3. **`test_no_empty_classes()`**: Prevents any class from having 0 samples
4. **`test_reasonable_class_distribution()`**: Ensures adequate sample counts
5. **`test_split_proportions()`**: Verifies 80/20 split ratio
6. **`test_data_consistency()`**: Ensures no data loss during splitting
7. **`test_temporal_coverage()`**: Verifies temporal integrity

### Running Tests:
```bash
python3 test_data_integrity.py
# Result: 🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED!
```
