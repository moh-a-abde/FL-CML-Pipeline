# Performance Optimization Summary

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Your federated learning pipeline was running extremely slowly with minimal improvements due to:

1. **Excessive XGBoost Rounds**: `NUM_LOCAL_ROUND = 82` (from tuned_params.py)
2. **Inefficient Training Method**: Manual update loop in `_local_boost()` without early stopping
3. **Conservative Learning Rate**: `eta = 0.05` causing slow convergence
4. **Complex Trees**: `max_depth = 8` increasing training time

### Performance Impact:
- **Each FL Round**: 5 clients × 82 XGBoost rounds = 410 total XGBoost rounds
- **5 FL Rounds**: 5 × 410 = 2,050 total XGBoost rounds
- **Runtime**: 2+ hours with minimal improvements (accuracy improving by only ~0.001 per round)

## ✅ Optimizations Applied

### 1. **Reduced NUM_LOCAL_ROUND: 82 → 15 (5.5x reduction)**
```python
# tuned_params.py
NUM_LOCAL_ROUND = 15  # Was: 82
'num_boost_round': 15  # Was: 82
```

### 2. **Faster Learning Rate: 0.05 → 0.1 (2x faster convergence)**
```python
# tuned_params.py
'eta': 0.1  # Was: 0.05
```

### 3. **Simpler Trees: depth 8 → 6**
```python
# tuned_params.py
'max_depth': 6  # Was: 8
```

### 4. **Enhanced Early Stopping in _local_boost()**
```python
# client_utils.py - _local_boost() method
bst = xgb.train(
    self.params,
    dtrain_weighted,
    num_boost_round=self.num_local_round,
    xgb_model=bst_input,
    evals=[(self.valid_dmatrix, "validate"), (dtrain_weighted, "train")],
    early_stopping_rounds=10,  # NEW: Early stopping
    verbose_eval=False  # NEW: Reduced verbosity
)
```

### 5. **Added Sample Weights in _local_boost()**
```python
# client_utils.py
sample_weights = compute_sample_weight('balanced', y_train_int)
dtrain_weighted = xgb.DMatrix(
    self.train_dmatrix.get_data(), 
    label=y_train, 
    weight=sample_weights,
    feature_names=self.train_dmatrix.feature_names
)
```

## 📊 Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- **NUM_LOCAL_ROUND**: 82
- **Time per FL round**: ~30 minutes
- **5 FL rounds**: ~2.5 hours
- **Total XGBoost rounds**: 2,050
- **Convergence**: Very slow, minimal improvements

### After Optimization:
- **NUM_LOCAL_ROUND**: 15
- **Time per FL round**: ~3-5 minutes  
- **5 FL rounds**: ~15-25 minutes
- **Total XGBoost rounds**: 375
- **Convergence**: Faster, better improvements per round

### **🚀 Expected Speedup: 6-10x faster training!**

## 🔍 Why These Changes Work

1. **Fewer Rounds**: 15 rounds is often sufficient for XGBoost to learn patterns in federated settings
2. **Higher Learning Rate**: Faster convergence without sacrificing much accuracy
3. **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting and unnecessary training when validation loss plateaus
4. **Simpler Trees**: Reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance
5. **Sample Weights**: Better class balance handling improves convergence

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Test the Improvements

1. **Run the Performance Test**:
```bash
python quick_performance_test.py
```

2. **Start Your FL Training**:
```bash
python sim.py --csv-file data/received/final_dataset.csv --num-rounds 5
```

3. **Monitor the Results**:
   - Each FL round should complete in ~3-5 minutes (vs ~30 minutes before)
   - You should see faster convergence with better improvements per round
   - Total training time should be ~15-25 minutes (vs 2+ hours before)

## 🎯 Next Steps if Still Slow

If you're still experiencing slow performance, consider:

1. **Further reduce NUM_LOCAL_ROUND to 10**
2. **Increase eta to 0.15** for even faster convergence
3. **Reduce dataset size** for initial testing
4. **Use fewer FL rounds** (3 instead of 5) for quick validation

## 📈 Monitoring Performance

Watch for these indicators of success:
- ✅ Each FL round completes in under 5 minutes
- ✅ Accuracy improvements > 0.01 per round
- ✅ Training log shows early stopping being triggered
- ✅ Total training time under 30 minutes

## 🔧 Files Modified

1. **tuned_params.py**: Reduced rounds and optimized hyperparameters
2. **client_utils.py**: Enhanced `_local_boost()` with early stopping and sample weights
3. **quick_performance_test.py**: New performance testing script

The optimizations should dramatically improve your training speed while maintaining or improving model performance!
