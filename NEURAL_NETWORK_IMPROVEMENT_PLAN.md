# Neural Network Performance Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the FL-CML-Pipeline neural network implementation. Current performance shows accuracy of 72.2% with significant class-wise performance variations despite balanced data. The proposed improvements target architectural enhancements, loss function optimization, data distribution fixes, and advanced training techniques to achieve 80-85% accuracy.

## Current Performance Analysis

### Metrics Overview
- **Accuracy**: 72.2%
- **Precision**: 74.54% (weighted)
- **Recall**: 72.2% (weighted)
- **F1-Score**: 70.44% (weighted)
- **Loss**: 0.7655 (high)

### Class-wise Performance Analysis (from ROC curves)
| Class | AUC Score | Performance Level | Issues |
|-------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| 0 | 0.60 | Poor | Low discriminative power |
| 1 | 0.89 | Good | Acceptable performance |
| 2 | 0.98 | Excellent | Strong performance |
| 3 | 0.60 | Poor | Low discriminative power |
| 4 | 0.76 | Fair | Moderate performance |
| 5 | 0.88 | Good | Acceptable performance |
| 6 | 0.90 | Excellent | Strong performance |
| 7 | 0.97 | Excellent | Strong performance |
| 8 | 0.87 | Good | Acceptable performance |
| 9 | 0.86 | Good | Acceptable performance |
| 10 | 0.98 | Excellent | Strong performance |

**Key Observation**: Despite balanced dataset (15,000 samples per class), significant performance gaps exist between classes, indicating fundamental learning difficulties rather than data imbalance.

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Inadequate Loss Function
**Location**: `src/neural_network/trainer.py:47`
```python
self.criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
```

**Problems**:
- Standard CrossEntropy treats all misclassifications equally
- No differentiation between hard and easy samples
- Poor performance on intrinsically difficult classes (0, 3, 4)
- No class-specific learning adaptation

### Issue 2: Severely Flawed Federated Data Distribution
**Location**: `src/neural_network/run_federated.py:57-65`
```python
# Create non-overlapping splits
indices = np.argsort(y_train)
client_indices = indices[i::num_clients]
```

**Problems**:
- Sorting destroys random distribution
- Each client gets heavily biased class distribution
- Violates federated learning principles
- Reduces model generalization capability

### Issue 3: Suboptimal Model Architecture
**Location**: `src/neural_network/run_federated.py:110-115`
```python
hidden_sizes=[256, 128, 64]
dropout_rate=0.3
```

**Problems**:
- Insufficient depth for 11-class cyber-attack classification
- Low dropout rate for complex feature spaces
- No advanced regularization techniques
- Basic activation function choice

### Issue 4: Inadequate Training Strategy
**Current Implementation Gaps**:
- No learning rate scheduling
- Basic optimizer configuration
- No advanced regularization techniques
- Single training round in federated setup

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Implement Focal Loss with Class Weighting

#### Focal Loss Implementation
```python
class FocalLoss(nn.Module):
    """
    Focal Loss implementation for addressing hard sample learning.
    Paper: "Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection" (Lin et al., 2017)
    """
    def __init__(self, alpha=None, gamma=2.0, reduction='mean'):
        super(FocalLoss, self).__init__()
        self.alpha = alpha  # Class weights tensor
        self.gamma = gamma  # Focusing parameter (higher = more focus on hard samples)
        self.reduction = reduction
        
    def forward(self, inputs, targets):
        # Standard cross-entropy
        ce_loss = F.cross_entropy(inputs, targets, reduction='none')
        
        # Calculate pt (probability of true class)
        pt = torch.exp(-ce_loss)
        
        # Apply focal term: (1-pt)^gamma
        focal_loss = (1 - pt) ** self.gamma * ce_loss
        
        # Apply class weights if provided
        if self.alpha is not None:
            if self.alpha.type() != inputs.data.type():
                self.alpha = self.alpha.type_as(inputs.data)
            alpha_t = self.alpha.gather(0, targets.data.view(-1))
            focal_loss = alpha_t * focal_loss
            
        return focal_loss.mean() if self.reduction == 'mean' else focal_loss
```

### Solution 2: Enhanced Model Architecture

#### Advanced Neural Network Architecture
```python
class ImprovedNeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    """
    Enhanced neural network for cyber-attack classification with:
    - Deeper architecture
    - Advanced regularization
    - Residual connections
    - Batch normalization
    """
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        input_size: int,
        hidden_sizes: List[int] = [512, 256, 128, 64, 32],
        num_classes: int = 11,
        dropout_rate: float = 0.4,
        activation: str = 'leaky_relu',
        use_batch_norm: bool = True,
        use_residual: bool = True
    ):
        super().__init__()
        
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_sizes = hidden_sizes
        self.num_classes = num_classes
        self.dropout_rate = dropout_rate
        self.use_batch_norm = use_batch_norm
        self.use_residual = use_residual
        
        # Build enhanced architecture
        self._build_layers()
        self._initialize_weights()
    
    def _build_layers(self):
        """Build enhanced layer architecture with regularization."""
        layer_sizes = [self.input_size] + self.hidden_sizes
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList()
        self.batch_norms = nn.ModuleList()
        self.dropouts = nn.ModuleList()
        
        # Hidden layers with advanced regularization
        for i in range(len(layer_sizes) - 1):
            self.layers.append(nn.Linear(layer_sizes[i], layer_sizes[i + 1]))
            
            if self.use_batch_norm:
                self.batch_norms.append(nn.BatchNorm1d(layer_sizes[i + 1]))
            
            # Adaptive dropout (higher for earlier layers)
            layer_dropout = self.dropout_rate * (1.2 - 0.2 * i / len(layer_sizes))
            self.dropouts.append(nn.Dropout(layer_dropout))
        
        # Output layer
        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(self.hidden_sizes[-1], self.num_classes)
        
        # Activation function
        self.activation_fn = nn.LeakyReLU(0.1)
```

### Solution 3: Fix Federated Data Distribution

#### Stratified Client Data Distribution
```python
def create_stratified_client_data(X_train, y_train, num_clients=3, random_state=42):
    """
    Create stratified client data ensuring balanced class distribution.
    Each client gets representative samples from all classes.
    """
    from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit
    
    client_data = []
    remaining_X, remaining_y = X_train.copy(), y_train.copy()
    
    # Calculate client sizes (slightly different sizes for realism)
    total_samples = len(X_train)
    base_size = total_samples // num_clients
    client_sizes = [base_size] * (num_clients - 1) + [total_samples - base_size * (num_clients - 1)]
    
    for i, client_size in enumerate(client_sizes[:-1]):
        test_size = client_size / len(remaining_X)
        splitter = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=test_size, random_state=random_state + i)
        
        for train_idx, client_idx in splitter.split(remaining_X, remaining_y):
            client_X = remaining_X.iloc[client_idx] if hasattr(remaining_X, 'iloc') else remaining_X[client_idx]
            client_y = remaining_y.iloc[client_idx] if hasattr(remaining_y, 'iloc') else remaining_y[client_idx]
            
            # Update remaining data
            remaining_X = remaining_X.iloc[train_idx] if hasattr(remaining_X, 'iloc') else remaining_X[train_idx]
            remaining_y = remaining_y.iloc[train_idx] if hasattr(remaining_y, 'iloc') else remaining_y[train_idx]
            
            client_data.append((client_X, client_y))
            break
    
    # Last client gets remaining data
    client_data.append((remaining_X, remaining_y))
    
    return client_data
```
