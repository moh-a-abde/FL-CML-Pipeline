# FL-CML-Pipeline: Progress Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a privacy-preserving machine learning solution using federated learning with the Flower framework. The system allows multiple clients to collaboratively train XGBoost models for network intrusion detection without sharing raw data, preserving privacy while achieving high model performance.

## Key Components

### 1. Federated Learning Architecture

- **Server Implementation (`server.py`)**
  - Controls the federated learning process
  - Implements both bagging and cyclic training strategies
  - Handles model aggregation and evaluation
  - Manages client selection and coordination

- **Client Implementation (`client.py`)**
  - Loads and processes local data
  - Trains local models based on server instructions
  - Participates in the federated learning process
  - Reports results back to the server

### 2. Data Pipeline

- **Data Processing (`dataset.py`)**
  - Loads CSV data from network traffic captures
  - Implements preprocessing for network traffic features
  - Provides multiple partitioning strategies (IID, Linear, Square, Exponential)
  - Handles data format conversions for XGBoost compatibility

- **Real-time Data Capture**
  - Support for live network traffic capture
  - Processing and conversion to training datasets

### 3. Utility Functions

- **Client Utilities (`client_utils.py`)**
  - XGBoost client implementation
  - Client-side helper functions

- **Server Utilities (`server_utils.py`)**
  - Server-side helper functions
  - Client management systems
  - Results handling and storage

### 4. Experiment Framework

- **Training Methods**
  - Bagging approach (`run_bagging.sh`): Aggregates models from multiple clients
  - Cyclic approach (`run_cyclic.sh`): Passes model sequentially through clients

- **Evaluation**
  - Supports both centralized and federated evaluation
  - Tracks multiple metrics (precision, recall, F1 score)
